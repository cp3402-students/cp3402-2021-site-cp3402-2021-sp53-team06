This is a website that we built up on WordPress, and this website is about selling cakes. It contains three pages: HOME; CAKE; ABOUT.  It displays special cakes on the home page, and customers can check the types and prices of cakes and make reservations directly by a call. In addition, we also created a custom theme, so we can directly install and modify. After completing the website, we purchased the domain name and created a site for it in GoDaddy.

And, these three files can help people who never use wordpress before to understand wordpress quickly:
